# Kusum Chauhan's Learning Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Kusum Chauhan, and I am currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Data Structures, and React.js. This repository serves as a personal learning log where I maintain and organize my code and notes for each of these technologies.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository contains code and files related to a specific topic. As I continue to learn and grow my skills, I will be updating and expanding this repository with new content and projects.

### Folder Breakdown:
- `html/`: Contains projects and exercises related to HTML.
- `css/`: Includes CSS practice and projects.
- `javascript/`: Contains JavaScript practice and projects.
- `data-structures/`: Implements and explores various data structures.
- `react-js/`: Contains projects and exercises related to React.js.

## Technology Introductions

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It structures the content on the web and defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of web pages, allowing for responsive and visually appealing designs.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that enables dynamic content and interactivity on web pages. It allows developers to create responsive features, handle events, manipulate the DOM, and build complex web applications.

### Data Structures
Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. Understanding data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs is crucial for solving computational problems and optimizing algorithms.

### React.js
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently. React's component-based architecture makes it a popular choice for developing modern web applications.
