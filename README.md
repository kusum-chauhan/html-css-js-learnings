# Kusum Chauhan's Learning Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Kusum Chauhan, and I am currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Data Structures, and React.js. This repository serves as a personal learning log where I maintain and organize my code and notes for each of these technologies.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository contains code and files related to a specific topic. As I continue to learn and grow my skills, I will be updating and expanding this repository with new content and projects.

### Folder Breakdown:
- `html/`: Contains projects and exercises related to HTML.
- `css/`: Includes CSS practice and projects.
- `javascript/`: Contains JavaScript practice and projects.
- `data-structures/`: Implements and explores various data structures.
- `react-js/`: Contains projects and exercises related to React.js.

## Technology Introductions

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It structures the content on the web and defines elements such as:
- **Tags**: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<table>`, etc.
- **Attributes**: `id`, `class`, `href`, `src`, `alt`, etc.
- **Forms**: `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of web pages. Key topics include:
- **Selectors**: Type, class, ID, attribute selectors.
- **Box Model**: Margin, border, padding, content.
- **Flexbox & Grid**: Layout techniques for responsive designs.
- **Positioning**: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries, viewport units.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that enables dynamic content and interactivity on web pages. Important topics include:
- **Syntax & Operators**: Variables, data types, operators.
- **Control Structures**: `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **Functions**: Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: `getElementById`, `querySelector`, event handling.
- **ES6 Features**: Let/const, template literals, destructuring, modules.

### Data Structures
Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. Key data structures include:
- **Arrays**: Index-based collection.
- **Linked Lists**: Nodes with pointers.
- **Stacks & Queues**: LIFO and FIFO structures.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees.
- **Graphs**: Nodes and edges representation.
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value pairs.

### React.js
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Important concepts include:
- **Components**: Functional and class components.
- **JSX**: Syntax extension for React.
- **Props & State**: Managing component data.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Component lifecycle hooks.
- **Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks.
- **Routing**: `react-router` for navigation.
